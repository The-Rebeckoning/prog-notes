**Interquartile range (IQR)
**
Interquartile range is the difference between the third and first quartile of data.

IQR = Q3 - Q1

It is the amount of of the spread in the middle 50% of a dataset. It's also called the midspread. Use the IQR to assess the variability where most of your values lie. 


**Variance and standard deviation of a population
**

Variance

Standard deviation indicates how far away a value is from the mean. Colloquily, 



Standard deviation is useful when comparing the spread of two separate data sets that have approximately the same mean. The data set with the smaller standard deviation has a narrower spread of measurements around the mean and therefore usually has comparatively fewer high or low values. An item selected at random from a data set whose standard deviation is low has a better chance of being close to the mean than an item from a data set whose standard deviation is higher. However, standard deviation is affected by extreme values. A single extreme value can have a big impact on the standard deviation.
