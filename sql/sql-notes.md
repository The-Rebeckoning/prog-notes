# The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character


	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
