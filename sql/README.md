### SQL Notes

This SQL Notebook focuses on how the language is used to manage data held in a relational database management system. 

It includes:
- Pictures and sample queries
- How to identify a subset of data needed from specific column/columns and write a SQL query to limit to those results.
- How to Use SQL commands to filter, sort, and summarize data.
- How to join multiple tables.
- How to manipulate different data types including strings, dates, & numeric data using functions.


### NoSQL Notes

This NoSQL Notebook provides the basics of NoSQL. I used [M001 MongoDB Basics](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about) to create the notebook. It provides information on creating queries managing data using the document-oriented product. It also discusses how MongoDB uses JSOSN and BSON to store data and the advantages of using NoSQL instead of traditional RDBMS.
