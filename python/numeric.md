# Methods for numeric data types
## abs()
The Python abs() method returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number is the number's distance from 0. This makes any negative number positive, while positive numbers are unaffected. For example, abs(-9) would return 9, while abs(2) would return 2.
