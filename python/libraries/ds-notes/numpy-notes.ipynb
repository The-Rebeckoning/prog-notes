    "# What is Numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. If you try to build such a list, some of the elements' types are changed to end up with a homogeneous list. This is known as type coercion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and numpy arrays.\n",
